Modelica is a language for modeling of cyber-physical systems, supporting acausal connection of components governed by mathematical equations to facilitate modeling from first principles. It provides object-oriented constructs that facilitate reuse of models, and can be used conveniently for modeling complex systems containing, e.g., mechanical, electrical, electronic, magnetic, hydraulic, thermal, control, electric power or process-oriented subcomponents.
Learning the Modelica Language

We recommend learning the Modelica language through books or tutorials.
Using the Modelica Language

In order to use the Modelica Language you need a tool implementing the language - and to be more effective libaries of existing models.
